#Linear Regression Model: Predicting Tips

#Introduction

In this example, we'll explore a Linear Regression model using the tips dataset, where the total bill is the independent variable and the tip is the dependent variable. Our goal is to predict the tip amount based on the total bill.

#Dataset

Tips Dataset:

A classic dataset containing information on tips given by customers at a restaurant.

#Features:

Total Bill (Independent Variable): The total amount of the bill.

Tip (Dependent Variable): The amount of the tip given.

Size: 244 samples

Model

Linear Regression:

A simple linear model to predict the tip amount based on the total bill.

Equation: Tip = β0 + β1 * Total Bill + ε

Coefficients:

β0 (Intercept): 0.92

β1 (Slope): 0.15

Results

R-Squared: 0.46 (indicating a moderate fit)

Mean Squared Error: 0.85
